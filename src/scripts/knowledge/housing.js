                <p>This only affects people of working age, so if you are old enough to receive a state pension (of a pensionable age) then these changes will not affect you. 
                You are likely to be affected by these changes, especially if you are a single person with two or more bedrooms, 
                a couple with two or more bedrooms, or in a household whose children have grown up and left home.</p>
                <p>If you are of working age you therefore need to think very carefully before bidding for a property that has more bedrooms than housing benefit will allow for,

        <li>Putting up any form of extension or building</li> 
        <li>Adding to, changing, or replacing the fixtures, fittings, and appliances provided by us</li> 
        <li>Altering essential gas, electricity, and water services</li> 
        <li>Putting up a radio or television aerial or satellite dish</li> 
        <li>Decorating the outside of your home</li> 
        <li>Removing internal walls</li> 
        <li>Insulation (Walls & Lofts)</li> 
        <li>Conservatories (considered on an individual basis)</li> 
    </ul> 

    <p>However, the following are highly unlikely to be granted due to extra maintenance costs and potential structural problems:</p> 

    <ul> 
        <li>Loft conversions</li> 
        <li>Spiral staircases</li> 
        <li>Swimming pools</li> 
        <li>Extensions</li> 
        <li>Stair lifts in communal areas</li> 
    </ul> 

    <p>It is the customer's responsibility to seek and get any planning or building regulation approvals.</p> 

    <p>Every request for permission will be assessed using criteria and conditions appropriate to the particular request. These criteria and conditions will be explained in the letter sent in reply to the customer's permission request.</p> 

    <p>We will take action against any installations that are in breach of Health and Safety regulations.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to tell if something contains asbestos just by looking at it, unless it is labelled. If in doubt, you should assume that a material contains asbestos until it is confirmed otherwise. The only way to be absolutely sure is by getting it tested in a laboratory.

  <h3>What is CO Poisoning?</h3>
  <p>
    Unsafe gas appliances can produce a highly poisonous gas called carbon monoxide (CO). 
    It can cause death as well as serious long-term health problems such as brain damage. 
    CO is produced by the incomplete burning of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 
    This happens when a gas appliance has been incorrectly fitted, badly repaired, or poorly maintained. 
    It can also occur if flues, chimneys, or vents are blocked. Oil and solid fuels such as coal, wood, petrol, 
    and oil can also produce carbon monoxide.
  </p>

  <h3>Remember the Six Main Symptoms to Look Out For</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Dizziness</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Breathlessness</li>
    <li>Collapse</li>
    <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What to Do if You Suspect CO Poisoning?</h3>
  <p>
    Get fresh air immediately. Open doors and windows, turn off gas appliances and leave the house. 
    See your doctor immediately or go to the hospital - let them know that you suspect CO poisoning. 
    They can do a blood or breath test to check.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you think there is an immediate danger, call the Gas Emergency Helpline on <a href="tel:0800 111999">0800 111999</a>.

      <li>Work will be conducted in batches of 250-300 properties with a target of 60 completed properties per week.</li>

    <details class="details-accordion">
      <summary>Background</summary>
      <div class="details-accordion-content">
        <p>Installation of fences is the tenant’s responsibility.
        Over the last 12 years considerable investment has been made in the housing stock via the Decent Homes programme and other programmes. This has included some elements of electrical work particularly within bathrooms and kitchens. However, enhancing the overall electrical standard in homes / communal facilities was not a key requirement of the Decent Homes programme or for properties to achieve the government decent homes standard.</p>

        <p>Consequently, whilst the electrical condition of the stock is fair / good, there remain improvements required to provide a modern-day standard that will keep customers safe, contribute to digital inclusion, meet existing and future legislative standards and contribute to reducing the carbon footprint by providing energy efficient products.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="details-accordion">
      <summary>What will be included within the Electrical Upgrade Programme?</summary>
      <div class="details-accordion-content">
        <p>The aim of this programme is to bring all properties over time up to a modern-day electrical standard and move towards an electrical periodic test every 5 years as recommended by the National Council for Electrical Installation Contracting (NICEIC).</p>

        <p>Work will be released in batch orders of approximately 250 to 300 dwellings but on a geographical basis to enable the contractor(s) and the contract administrator to work efficiently. Once fully underway, 60 properties per week for each contractor will be completed. This programme will include the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Install Isolation Switch (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Carry out an initial periodic condition test and report</li>
          <li>Replace consumer units (where necessary only) to provide improved RCD protection and safety for residents</li>
          <li>Address Category 1, 2, and 3 issues identified by the periodic test</li>
          <li>Ensure earth bonding is adequate (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Install earth wiring to lighting circuits (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Install additional sockets and/or improve the spread of sockets including 2 USB equipped sockets</li>
          <li>Install hard-wired smoke alarms</li>
          <li>Install carbon monoxide detectors – risk-based approach</li>
          <li>Replace bathroom light fittings which are difficult to access to replace bulbs</li>
          <li>Install external lighting to houses, bungalows & flats (where no communal lighting presently exists)</li>
          <li>Carry out a final periodic test (if further work is carried out) to verify all electrics are operating correctly</li>
          <li>Not every dwelling will require all the above work.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The list above is a menu of activity which will be undertaken as required.</p>

        <p>Isolation switches allow the dwelling to be worked upon safely by electrical engineers. During the Decent Homes programme, thousands of isolation switches were installed, but we do not have full coverage. The upgrade project will enable us over time to install an isolation switch to every property.</p>

        <p>Consumer unit specifications change regularly, and in certain cases, we are not offering the most ideal protection. This project will ensure consumer units are suitable, up-to-date, and offer the best protection to our residents.</p>

        <p>Category 1 & 2 issues identified from the periodic test will be rectified. Category 3 issues will be rectified based on a cost/benefit analysis.</p>

        <p>Earth bonding is very often disrupted as a result of other works. This project will ensure that earth bonding is maintained and is effective.</p>

        <p>Earth wiring to lighting circuits will be installed, enabling residents to use metal lighting accessories safely. At present, metal accessories have to be removed if found for Health & Safety reasons.</p>

    <details class="details-accordion">
      <summary>Meeting Modern Day Standards - Additional Sockets and/or spread of sockets</summary>
      <div class="details-accordion-content">
        <p>Due to the age of the stock many of the dwellings do not have sufficient sockets or a sufficient spread of sockets which meet customer needs and the increasing use of technology in the home which leads to the overuse of trailing cables or socket extension leads. This can lead to Health and Safety issues. The Decent Homes programme did provide some improvements especially in kitchens but there is still work to do in many dwellings to improve the socket provision. There is no current programme to cover this work.</p>

        <p>Evidence from the teams working on the ground indicates that customer DIY work to electrics is putting residents at risk. For example, the erection of external lighting in response to security concerns, additional sockets not installed by a qualified installer, surface mounted sockets and trailing cables.</p>

        <p>Hard Wired Smoke Alarms - There is around 10,000 hard wired smoke alarms within the stock. All high risk properties such as sheltered, and towers have hard wired smoke alarms with the exception of Deer Park tower blocks. This block needs to be addressed ASAP in response to recommendations from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</p>

        <p>Additionally properties that are rewired always have hard wired alarms installed at the same time as it is part of the rewire specification. Legislation does not currently insist we install hard wired to all dwellings managed by Housing Services, but it may do in near future as there is national lobbying to government by the Fire Service. Hard wired alarms are part of the building regulations for new build. In the meantime, we have battery smoke alarms within the remaining stock which are checked annually by the gas and district heating servicing programmes.</p>

        <p>Carbon Monoxide Detectors - There are very few carbon monoxide detectors within the stock as a whole. Once again, the legislation surrounding carbon monoxide detectors does not insist on their use but increasingly there is recommendation for their use in general housing stock. Carbon Monoxide detectors are part of the building regulations for new build. It is recommended that the housing service installs Carbon Monoxide detectors on a risk-based approach at the same time as other electrical improvement work and / or when hard wired smoke alarms are installed. There is no current programme.</p>

        <p>Replacing bathroom light fittings which are difficult to access – since the new requirement for bathroom light fittings were introduced approx.10 to 12 years ago tenants have had difficulty removing the cover and changing the light bulbs. Some of the fittings are particularly difficult to access. This programme will identify these fittings and replace with a more suitable unit. The unit will be LED.</p>

        <p>External Lighting – A report from Birmingham University presented to the Burglary Theme Group in 2014 provided evidence that external lighting can reduce the incidence of burglary and is the most effective of all the crime reduction measures that can be applied to a home including burglar alarms. Including this work as part of an upgrade project will present tenants with a safer environment in which to live.</p>

    <li> The District Heating Meter location may vary but is usually located in the property airing cupboard. Does The Meters Home Screen say ON in the top right corner? Is your heating programmer turned on? </li>
    <li> To activate an emergency credit, press the blue button, marked ‘Press For Em Credit’ as instructed by the meters home screen. This will allow the tenant to ‘borrow’ credit up to £10.00 which will connect your heat and hot water supply for a short time. This is simply a loan and will need to be repaid on receipt of the prepayment information/number which will be with them shortly. </li>
    <li> If the Meters screen in blank or shows something similar to ‘D bug’ then the customer can reboot the G6 unit by pressing the blue and orange button together for 10 seconds. </li>
    <li>If the reboot is unsuccessful or for any other repair, please call the Repairs line on <a href="tel:0114 2735555">0114 2735555</a></li>

      Under the Regulatory Reform Order (2005), landlords are required to ensure
      that fire risk assessments are carried out in any shared areas of any
      properties they manage. Landlords also need to ensure that any fire escape
      routes and entrances/exits to properties are clear from trip hazards and items
      which would prevent exit from the building in the event of an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>As such, please do not place in the communal area, items such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chairs and tables</li>
      <li>Bookcases</li>
      <li>Loose carpets</li>
      <li>Curtains, blinds or net curtains</li>

      <li>
        Motorbikes, mopeds or any other equipment which uses petrol/diesel or gas
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If any of these items, or any other item which is felt to be a fire risk, are
      left in your communal area we will ask residents to remove them. If they
      remain they will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bicycles, prams, pushchairs and similar items will not normally be permitted
      to be stored or located within the internal communal parts unless there is an
      area capable of storage without causing obstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can have a small doormat if it is rubber backed. Edged and trimmed natural
      plants in ceramic, earthenware or metal pots, as long as they are not placed
      on stairs or landings which are the means of escape from the building.

      2023.

  <h3>Bogus Callers</h3>
  <p>
    All Council Housing Service staff, surveyors, and contractors carry identification cards at all times. It is important that you always ask to see identification before you let anyone into your home. If you have any doubts about a caller’s identity, do not let them in.
    <br><br>
    Council Officers NEVER ask a household for cash on the doorstep. You should always be alert to protect yourself against bogus callers. If you are suspicious about any caller’s identity, you should call the police immediately.

  "Guidelines for housing benefit claims in scenarios like dual liabilities, fleeing violence, delayed occupation, or hospitalisation.",
  `
      <h4>Unavoidable liability</h4>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> When tenants sign for a tenancy and have moved in but have a liability on another property.</p>
      <p>This is where a tenant has signed for a Council property but has a liability at another property. 
        This usually occurs when they have to give four weeks' notice on the property 
        they have left but are inclined to take the Council Housing Service property.</p>
      <p>To make a claim for unavoidable liability, a written request needs to be made by the tenant. 
        As it is discretionary, they will then need to satisfy the criteria 
        as stated on the enclosed letter within the standard 28 days of the application. 
        For housing benefit to be paid on the Council Housing Service property, 
        the tenants will need to be physically living at the property. 
        If not, housing benefit cannot be paid under unavoidable liability rules.</p>
  
      <h4>Fleeing violence</h4>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Where a tenant is fleeing violence and has been put into other accommodation.</p>
      <p>If someone is fleeing violence, and they state that they have an intention to return home if the threat of violence is lifted, 
        then they can claim housing benefit on two homes if they have a rental liability at 
        the property they are fleeing and the one that they are currently occupying.</p>
      <p>They will need to complete a housing benefit claim for both homes.</p>
      <p>To successfully claim housing benefit, they will need to confirm in writing that they have an intention 
        to return to the property once the threat of violence is removed. 
        They may also need to provide proof, such as a letter from the police, 
        a crime reference number, or a letter from the Council Housing Service.</p>
  
      <h4>Benefit prior to occupation</h4>
      <p><strong>Basic principles:</strong> Benefit prior to occupation can only be paid when housing benefit is <u>not</u> being paid at any other property.</p>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Tenant(s) sign for a property but there is a delay in moving into the property.</p>
      <p>A tenant(s) may qualify for up to four weeks of benefit prior to occupation if the delay in moving was 
        reasonable and they were waiting for a social fund payment for a need connected with the move (e.g., removal expenses or help to set up home). 
        This only applies if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They have a child of five or under living with them.</li>
        <li>They are 60 or over and neither they nor their partner are receiving Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA).</li>
        <li>They are under 60 (or they or their partner are receiving IS or JSA) and qualify for one of the pensioner premiums or 
          a disability, severe disability, or disabled child premium.</li>
        <li>They were waiting for adaptations to be completed to meet needs due to a disability (must be structural, not decorative).</li>
        <li>They became liable for payments while a hospital patient or in residential accommodation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Housing benefit is not paid until the tenants move in, and they should have already informed the local authority (LA) of their intent to move. 
        A new claim must be made within four weeks of the actual move-in date.</p>
      <p>If the above criteria are not met, then a tenant will not be able to claim housing benefit until they move in.</p>
      <p>You will need to inform the tenant that if they do not move in and do not meet the above criteria, 
        they will be liable for full rent until they move into the property.</p>
  
      <h4>In hospital</h4>
      <p>If a tenant is in hospital during the time they have signed up for the property, 
        they will not be entitled to housing benefit until they actually move into the property.</p>
      <p>If this is the case, it can be argued that they have moved the majority of their possessions into the 
        property and that this is their main home (as per the basic principles). 
        However, this does not apply if they have a property elsewhere.</p>

    <p>
      If you live in an ex-Council flat or maisonette property you are a leaseholder
      of Sheffield City Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a landlord, the Council are responsible for calculating and issuing bills to leaseholders.
      These may be for service charges and similar costs, as well as for major works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council are only responsible for communal repairs; Leaseholders are responsible
      for repairs within their own property.
    </p>
    <h3>What service charges cover</h3>
    <p>
      Service charges cover all works and services carried out to the structure of the block and communal
      areas, including cleaning of communal areas, lighting, lift maintenance and upkeep of gardens. It also
      covers day-to-day repairs, maintenance and improvement work.
    </p>
    <h3>Cost of service charges</h3>
    <p>
      Service charges for leaseholders are paid annually and vary depending on the cost incurred to the
      block during the service charge year, which runs from 1st October to 30th September. Customers will
      pay a share of the costs calculated for their block. For example; if there are 8 dwellings in a block,
      service charges will amount to 1/8th of the total cost.
    </p>
    <h3>Difficulty paying service charge</h3>
    <p>
      Leaseholders can now pay service charges by instalments, spreading the cost over 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      For larger items of work commanding higher costs, Leaseholders should contact the Council to discuss tailored repayment options.
    </p>
    <h3>Subletting a property</h3>
    <p>
      As a leaseholder you have the right to sublet your home. This means that you may take in lodgers or rent your home to someone else, if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also need to advise your mortgage lender if you do rent out your home.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will remain responsible for ensuring that the terms of the lease are complied with and you will remain liable for any breaches,
      regardless of whether the breaches are committed by you, your sub-tenant or other parties connected to your sub-tenant.
      You will therefore be responsible for the behaviour of your sub-tenant(s). This would include, for example, ensuring that they do not cause a nuisance to neighbours.

            The Allocations Policy advises various circumstances in which we will
            reduce the preference given to applicants on the Housing Register or
            prevent them from joining the register. These include circumstances such
            as rent arrears or past/current anti-social behaviour.
            <br>
            <br>
            An Exception Request allows us to make decisions on whether it is
            appropriate to waive these restrictions in exceptional circumstances, such
            as awarding a priority or when an applicant wishes to move to more
            suitable accommodation using their waiting time due to a change in
            circumstances.
            <br>
            <br>
            Applicants must demonstrate exceptional circumstances and prove that they
            have taken action to rectify issues that led to reduced preference or

  "Eligibility",
  "Check eligibility for Sheffield's Housing Register, including age, immigration status, and documentation requirements for application.",
  `
      <p>
        Sheffield City Council operates an open register and therefore any person over
        the age of 16 can apply to join the Housing Register. However, generally you
        will not be made an offer of a property until you are at least 18 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Housing Act 1996 prevents Local Authorities from offering a property to
        some people because of their immigration status. We will let you know if this
        applies to you after you register.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are eligible to register you may do so by completing the online
        application form. Following this, you will be provided with a login reference
        number and required to provide a memorable date which will act as your
        password for logging in to the website in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some people who are not eligible to be included on the Housing
        Register. These are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain people who are subject to Immigration Control under the 1996 Asylum
        and Immigration Act.
        <br />
        Certain people from abroad who are not subject to immigration control but who
        are not habitually resident in the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or
        the Republic of Ireland.
        <br />
        People (including members of their household) who have been guilty of
        unacceptable behaviour that makes them unsuitable to be a tenant.
      </p>
      <h3>After submitting your application</h3>
      <p>
        After submitting your application online you will be asked to provide us with
        various documentation such as identification and a reference. You may also be
        asked to provide evidence of your immigration status where relevant. You
        should make sure that all of this documentation is available to you before
        completing your online application as you need to submit this
        documentation immediately. Failure to provide this within the given timescales
        will mean you will need to restart the process from the beginning by
        submitting a further online application.
      </p>
      <h3>Eligibility Table</h3>
      <p>
        A copy of the eligibility table can be found 
        <a href="https://sccextranet.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/CustomerServiceKnowledgeCouncilHousing/EbdSLAAvW9JGiy9NqU1kK10B4dnbAzvX4hi3YjglwR3TDQ?e=Nicw6D&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI0OS8yNDEwMjAwMTMxOCIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Relaxed eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        Relaxed eligibility criteria is uncommon, but has sometimes been applied in
        the past to properties that receive no bids and/or have a known low demand.
        The majority of these properties were maisonettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties where relaxed eligibility has been applied will have a message in
        the 'Show full details>>Further information' box of the property advert.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Example: A 3 bed maisonette with relaxed eligibility will have a message
        similar to this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Households eligible for 2 bed properties can bid and a financial assessment
        will be carried out to check that the property is affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a customer then places a bid for the property and comes first, IMFIT
        (Rents) will contact the customer prior to any offer to ensure that the
        customer is able to afford the property.

  <h3>Adoption</h3>
  
  <p> Social Services will undertake an initial visit to assess the size of the applicant’s current accommodation. 
  Bedroom eligibility in these situations will only be amended once we have received confirmation to go ahead from Social Services. Upon receipt of confirmation, the bedroom eligibility can be amended. 
  An e-mail from Social Services will be the normal route to receive confirmation. </p>
  
     <h3>Fostering</h3>
  
     <p>Fostering has a different process. 
     Until an applicant is suitably housed an assessment cannot begin. 
     Confirmation from Social Services in the form of an email stating the applicant has made an application to foster is the requirement 
     to change bedroom eligibility. Upon receipt of confirmation, the bedroom eligibility can be amended. 
     An e-mail from Social Services will be the normal route to receive confirmation. 
     However staff advising potential foster carers must advise the applicant of the benefit implications of moving to a 
     larger property if the child / children are not placed with them immediately after they move or they do not proceed with the 
     application to foster after they are rehoused.</p>

        water and waste services. Our priority is to provide you with a safe living environment. 
        We will ensure that:<br><br>
  
        Sometimes delays may occur due to unforeseen work that is required to bring the property up
        to a standard that meets our Vacant Charter.  
        When the property is ready, we will contact you to arrange an appointment to view the property 
        and then to sign for your new tenancy, should you choose to accept. In some circumstances 
        we may arrange a ‘work in progress’ viewing.<br><br>

        not seriously affecting the use of the property and would require a small amount of work to rectify 
        the given problems. To have completed these within the prior repairs programme/work schedule 
        would have unnecessarily held up the letting, leaving a property standing ‘idle’ whilst there were 
        people needing re-housing. The ‘on-tenancy’ repairs can be completed once you have moved in 
        and will cause very little in the way of disruption, mess or upheaval.
      </p>
  
      <h4>Gas / Electricity supplier</h4>
      <p>
        Any known utilities suppliers information will be provided in the Sign-up pack.
  
        The responsibility/contractual agreement for arranging the supply 
        (and the utility meter installation if necessary) is with the customer and 
        the utility provider e.g. British Gas, Powergen etc.<br><br>
  
        If the supplier is not known, the customer will need to contact one of the numbers below, 
        and then contact the utility supplier themselves:<br><br>
  
        <strong>Gas</strong> - Call the M Number Enquiry Line on <a href="tel:0870 6081524">0870 6081524</a>, provided by xoserve Ltd. 
        They will tell you the supplier and give you your Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN).<br><br>
  
        <strong>Electricity</strong> - Call your local electricity distribution company and ask for their Meter 
        Point Administration Service (MPAS). Alternatively, contact <a href="tel:00845 0707172">0845 0707172</a>.
      </p>
  
      <h4>Meter Readings</h4>
      <p>
        The meter reading before they moved in - you will have been advised of this at sign up 
        and the information will have been provided in their sign up pack. (We also advise Customers 
        to take their own meter readings and contact the utility company themselves.)<br><br>
  
        The meter reading when they move out - you should contact the utility company themselves.

    <p>
      Priority for rehousing can be awarded if there is a need to be rehoused urgently and immediately. When your circumstances have been assessed, we will look at whether we can give you priority for housing ahead of other people on the Housing Register. We will then write to you explaining our decision. If we give you priority, we will explain why it has been given, what sort of property it is for and how long you have to use it. The letter will also explain how to request a review of the decision if you are unhappy with it.<br><br>
  
      In some cases we will make you an offer of a property that we feel meets your needs. If we are unable to contact you due to changes not notified to us, your registration may be suspended or cancelled.<br><br>
  
      If you may be eligible for a priority you will be asked to provide us with further information. Once you have been assessed, we will write to you and explain whether you have been given priority. If you are given priority the letter will explain what sort of properties you can bid for with the priority and when the priority will be reviewed.<br><br>
  
      We will write to you and explain why if you have not been awarded a priority. We will tell you if you can request a review of the decision and how to go about this. In many cases, if you are not given priority but need further assistance, we will work with you, your advocates and our partner agencies to provide advice and assistance.<br><br>
  
      A priority does not affect your waiting time, you can apply for properties with both your waiting time and your priority. For most of the properties advertised we will consider people with priority first. If you have a priority, you must keep bidding for suitable properties. Even with a priority, you may have to bid for a considerable time before you are offered a property. In order for our system to be fair, a proportion of properties are also let on the basis of an applicant's waiting time on the housing register. This will be clearly shown in the property adverts.<br>

      <h3>Priority Banding Table</h3>
  
      <p>The table below shows the list of priorities and the bands they fall in. </p>
  
      <p>Some of the priorities span multiple bands and we cannot give a definitive answer for which band they will be in e.g. demolition and health. 
      As such, these are marked in the table below as ‘None’. </p>
  
      <p>Also marked as ‘None’ are the priorities which no longer exist. These are: </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Council Service tenant retiring or leaving employment</li>
        <li>Council service tenant who is dismissed</li>
        <li>Special Case</li>
        <li>If a priority spans the bands, the awarding officer will have already spoken with the customer.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Effective Dates</h3>
  
      <p>Within bands A-D there is no hierarchy, offers will be made solely on the effective date within the band. For example, 
      three different priorities within the same band would be ordered based on the earliest effective date first.</p>
  
      <p>The only exception is band E which has the following hierarchy: </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>No Local Connection</li>
        <li>Refused Offers</li>
        <li>Unacceptable Behaviour </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How does Sheffield City Council allocate the property?</h3>
       <p>
        Once the bidding period has closed on a Tuesday night, bids for each property are sorted automatically based on the eligibility criteria. Full details of how we allocate properties can be found in Sheffield City Council’s Allocations Policy however in short:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Properties advertised to Waiting Time – These properties will be offered to customers in band D first in order of their effective date (oldest first). If no customers in band D accept the property, it will be offered to the other bands in the following order: band A, band B, band C, Band E.</li>
        <li>Properties advertised to Housing Register – These properties will be offered to customers with a priority in band A first in order of their effective date (oldest first). If no customers in band A accept the property, it will be offered to the other bands in the following order: band B, Band C, Band D, Band E.</li>
        <li>Properties advertised to First Come First Served – These properties will be offered to the customer who placed their bid first regardless of their band or effective date. The customer must still meet the minimum eligibility requirements in order for their bid to be considered.</li>
        <li>If your bid for a property was successful, we will contact you and invite you to view the property as soon as possible. We do not contact unsuccessful applicants however; you will be able to check your final bid position on the Sheffield Property Shop. You can do this by logging in to your account.</li>
        <li>There are some circumstances where a customer may come in first position for a property however due to other circumstances such as a debt to the Housing Service or a history of anti-social behaviour, they are bypassed and are not made the offer. We will let you know if we bypass you for an offer and explain how you can rectify this.</li>
        <li>Please note, if you make a bid for a property and your circumstances change or your priority ends during the bidding period, we will not offer you the property if you no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</li>

        <p>
          Current SCC tenants are not required to submit a reference as the Council is already aware of 
          their circumstances and tenancy history.<br>
          References were introduced as part of the Allocations Policy. The purpose of this is for SCC to better 
          understand the people who are currently on its Housing Register. <br>
          SCC often has very little knowledge of the people on the register and therefore requesting a reference will help the Council to improve this.

          All customers other than current SCC tenants now need to provide a reference when joining the Housing Register. 
          The following customers also need to provide a reference when creating a new application:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Housing Association tenants (Landlord needs to provide the reference)</li>
          <li>Tenants of other Councils (Landlord needs to provide the reference)</li>
          <li>Private rented tenants (Landlord needs to provide the reference - the landlord must not be a family member)</li>
          <li>Owner occupiers - no need for a reference as bidding is restricted</li>
          <li>Living with family/parents (18+ only, character reference is needed)</li>
          <li>NFA/Living with friends (Character reference is needed)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          For customers who currently do or have ever lived independently, the reference should be completed by their most recent landlord.
          Advisor note: For customers who are unable to provide a landlord's reference, they must gain agreement from the 
          Registration Team for what reference will be acceptable and they will send the professional reference form out.<br>
          If the customer is advising that there would be a charge for the reference, the customer would be responsible for 
          this charge. SCC will not pay landlords to provide a reference.

        band they have been placed in and how to challenge this if they feel it is incorrect. Customers who have 
        special or extenuating circumstances can request an Exception Request if they wish to do so. All such

  <h3>Reduced preference (demotion) following refusal of 3 reasonable offers</h3>
  <p> 
    If a customer is in band D and they have refused 3 offers in 12 months, the Sheffield City Council Allocations Policy states:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you refuse an offer of a property, you could be moved to a lower band or your application may be cancelled. The following will also be considered as a refusal:</li>
      <li>If you fail to respond to an offer of a property made to you within the timescales specified and do not have a good reason for this failure.</li>
      <li>If you fail to attend a viewing of a property offered to you within the timescales specified and do not have a good reason for this failure.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are to be Demoted, we will write to you 21 days before you are Demoted. If you do not respond, you will be Demoted to band E on the Housing Register for 12 months. After 12 months you can request to be moved back in to band D.
  </p>
     <h3>Disqualification following refusal of 3 reasonable offers</h3>
     <p>
      If a customer who is in band E refuses 3 reasonable offers, they can be disqualified from the Housing Register.<br>
      The customer will be notified in writing and they have 21 days to appeal the decision. <br>
      If we do not hear from the customer within 21 days, their housing application will be cancelled and they will be disqualified from the Housing Register for 12 months. <br>
      After 12 months the customer is able to submit an on-line application for Social Housing to re-join the Housing Register.

        The Allocations Policy advises of various circumstances where we will

        prevent them from joining the register. These include circumstances such
        as rent arrears or past/current anti-social behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the most serious debt cases, the Allocations Policy allows us to place
        applicants into band E or disqualify a customer from the Housing Register
        for an initial period of 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>A customer can apply for a restriction to be removed if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They are able to evidence that their behaviour has significantly improved
          (e.g., paying off arrears in full)
        </li>
        <li>They appeal the restriction (disqualification) within 21 days</li>
        <li>They have exceptional circumstances</li>
        <li>They need a priority</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If an applicant is allowed back on the housing register, they will have to
        re-register. ID and references will be required unless recently submitted.
        Usual checks will be carried out and the appropriate band chosen.

            The Tenants Levy is a weekly payment of 10p that is used to support community activity in our

            and Residents Associations (TARAs). Where there is currently no TARA, the levy is held by the 
            Council to support any future community activity in the local area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tenants can decide whether to pay the levy, which is not covered by Housing Benefit or Universal Credit.

            These letters are based on information produced on 8th February 2024, so any tenancy changes

            The benefit details included are as of 11th March 2024, so any changes in entitlement after that

    <h3>What is Extra Care Housing?</h3>
    <p>Extra Care Housing is based on 3 key principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To keep people as independent as possible.</li>
      <li>
        To allow someone to get services in their own home, without having to move
        to get them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accommodation designed to be adaptable so that people can get the care and
        support they need at home.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main features are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-contained flats or bungalows, with their own front door.</li>
      <li>Choice of tenure (rent, shared ownership or buy).</li>
      <li>High standards of design, with wheelchair access throughout.</li>
      <li>High level of security & safety features with alarm call systems.</li>
      <li>Flexible packages, tailored to individual care needs.</li>
      <li>24-hour care and support (Emergencies only from 10p.m. – 6 a.m.)</li>
      <li>
        Range of facilities, e.g. cafe, craft/activity room, IT suite, with a number
        of activities taking place weekly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Furnished Accommodation meets the need for good quality furnished housing for
      rent at affordable prices and offers an alternative for people residing in
      expensive bed and breakfast accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Properties are furnished with goods generally selected by the customer on a
      choice basis to meet their needs on a 3-tiered service charge arrangement.
      Fully furnished properties are decorated and carpeted throughout and curtains
      and tracks are provided and fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enquiries that are specifically regarding the information in this page can be
      sent to Furnished using the links at the bottom of the page. If the enquiry is
      related to other matters, for instance estate management, tenancy management
      or Anti-social behaviour (ASB), then the appropriate form should be used to process that enquiry.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished Accommodation Cost</h3>
    <p>
      The cost depends on the package chosen and there are 3 tiers: Gold, Silver and
      Bronze. These carry £10, £15 and £20 per week charge that is payable over and
      above the net rent charge for the property.
    </p>
    <p>How it works</p>
    <p>There are three price bands to choose from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold - £20 per week (20 points)</li>
      <li>Silver - £15 per week (15 points)</li>
      <li>Bronze - £10 per week (10 points)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each piece of furniture or floor covering will have a points value and the
      points will add up to package you want; Gold, Silver or Bronze. A Bronze
      package for example costs £10 a week and you can have 10 points worth of
      furniture (this could include a table and chairs, a settee, a fridge freezer
      and washing machine all at 2 points each and an armchair and crockery pack at
      1 point each). You can mix and match, depending on what furniture you already
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items of furniture and colour choices now available include washing machines,
      fridge freezers, vacuum cleaners, pots and pans and 3 colours of carpets and
      vinyl.
    </p>
    <h3>Customer wants an item of furniture replacing</h3>
    <p>
      The exchanging of furniture items is subject to a variety of factors
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The age of the goods as they still may be under warranty.</li>
      <li>
        If damaged – the reason for the damage - must be fair wear and tear or
        manufacturing fault / defect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most goods are assessed at the customer’s annual visit they receive and also
        all relevant electrical items are PAT tested at this time. The officer
        carrying out the visit will arrange any replacement goods if agreed and
        applicable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Customer no longer wants their furniture</h3>
    <p>
      There are instances where financial hardship may be caused by the service
      charge and / or the customer has sourced their own goods now. The process of
      removing the service charge is known as Deed of Variation and it takes
      approximately 10 weeks to complete as there are 2 notice periods with a 28 days
      cooling off periods legally built into them.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished and Local Assistance Scheme (LAS)</h3>
    <p>
      Furnished provide the goods and deliver them to customers who have applied for
      the grant / goods via Local Assistance Scheme. Furnished may provide
      installation at Council properties but do not perform installs at non-Council
      properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished on Demand</h3>
    <p>
      The service is only available to new customers who are signing up for a new
      Council tenancy.
    </p>
    <p>Acceptance criteria:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Applicants moving from any Temporary Accommodation property, Bed and
        Breakfast or Assessment Beds. The applicant must be currently bidding on
        Sheffield City Council properties and have a full homeless priority (This is
        generally bands A and B under the new Allocations policy).
      </li>
      <li>Applicants referred via a medical priority (Generally band A).</li>
      <li>
        Other applicants who would not be able to access a property without the
        Furnished Accommodation Service will be considered on a case-by-case basis
        (Most of these will be under band C in Allocations policy).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>(Most of these will be under band C in Allocations policy).</p>
    <p>
      NB: Budget constraints may impact on criteria 3 and criteria’s 1 & 2 will
      always take preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Customer does not meet the above criteria direct them to alternative
      options such as St Vincent De Pauls, Local Assistance Scheme or Emmaus.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished Delivery Schedule</h3>
    <p>
      Open the delivery schedule spreadsheet (copy the link:
      <a href=""G:/HSG/Public/Supported Hsg/Furnished Accommodation/Furnished delivery sheets/Furnished Delivery Sheet.xlsx"" target="_blank">"G:/HSG/Public/Supported Hsg/Furnished Accommodation\Furnished delivery sheets/Furnished Delivery Sheet.xlsx"</a> 
      and paste into the Windows Explorer title bar).

    <h3>What manages the sites?</h3>
    <p>
      Both sites are managed by the Housing and Neighbourhood Service Gypsy and
      Traveller Site Management team based at Solpro.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the roles of the team</h3>
    <p>The team deals with everything including:</p>

    <p>
      Sheltered housing is rented accommodation that is specially designed for older
      people who are able to live independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It aims to provide comfortable accommodation with added security, in an
      environment where customers can come and go as they please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enquiries that are specifically regarding the information in this form can be
      sent to OPIL using the links at the bottom of the form. If the enquiry is
      related to other matters, for instance, Estate Management, Tenancy Management
      or Anti-social behaviour (ASB), then the appropriate form should be used to process that enquiry.
    </p>
    <h3>Where are the properties?</h3>
    <p>
      Schemes are scattered all over the city. A comprehensive list of properties
      can be found on the council website or in the Older Persons Independent Living
      Service leaflet.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What does the Sheltered Neighbourhood Officer do and New Tenancy Support
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Neighbourhood Officers will complete a support plan with the tenant when
      they move in. This replaces the standard 'New Tenancy Visit' that
      non-Sheltered tenants receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan is reviewed every six months or when there is a change in
      circumstances. We will agree with the customer the type and frequency of
      contact they require based on the customers needs. The Neighbourhood Officer
      will manage a Sheltered tenancy in the same way that a Neighbourhood Officer
      based in an area team would manage a standard tenancy, but will also include
      any support agreed in the support plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Neighbourhood Officers will help and support the customer to access any
      services they may need to help them live independently. The Neighbourhood
      Officers wardens will also contact relatives, call a doctor or an ambulance in
      an emergency.
    </p>
    <h3>What does OPIL provide</h3>
    <p>
      Convenient and comfortable accommodation with added security, in an
      environment where residents have their own front door and can come and go as
      they please. We can usually provide the following accommodation and
      facilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Self contained flats/Studio apartments/Bungalows</li>
      <li>Communal Facilities such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Caretaking service for the communal areas</li>
          <li>City Wide Care Alarm (24 hour emergency response)</li>
          <li>Gardens</li>
          <li>Guest room</li>
          <li>Kitchen</li>
          <li>Laundry</li>
          <li>Lounge for social activities</li>
          <li>Neighbourhood Officer Warden</li>
          <li>Security and Safety features</li>
        </ul>
      </li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Who is eligible for OPIL accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone aged over 60 and is registered for rehousing. In the case of a couple,
      at least one person must fit the age requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before offering a property we will check to make sure it meets all your
      housing needs. You will also be invited to an accompanied viewing of the
      building without any commitment.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the costs of OPIL Accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      The cost of living in Sheltered Housing is very competitive when compared with
      other social housing providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You pay weekly rent and a service charge (where applicable) for the heating
      and hot water in your property and/or towards the heating in communal areas of
      the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an added support charge to cover the Neighbourhood Officer service
      and City Wide Alarm. If you are already in receipt of Housing Benefit you will
      not have to pay this charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are on a low income you can apply to have an assessment to see if you
      are entitled to any assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will receive help and advice on claiming Welfare and/or Housing Benefit at
      the start of your tenancy.
    </p>

  `<p><h3>Anti-social Behaviour</h3>
    <p>Anti-social behaviour is behaviour which is capable of causing nuisance, annoyance, harassment, alarm or distress to an individual or community. This could range from a relatively minor issue to serious criminal activity. We do not adopt a single definition of anti-social behaviour but instead consider each report based on the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Examples of behaviours we may consider to be anti-social are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Playing excessively loud music/television/video games</li>
      <li> Threatening or verbally abusing another person</li>
      <li> Damaging property</li>
      <li> Attacking another person</li>
      <li> Failing to control a pet / banned breed pet</li>
      <li> Misusing drugs or alcohol</li>
      <li> Incorrect disposal of rubbish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of behaviours we may not consider to be anti-social are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Reasonable household noise</li>
      <li> Carrying out DIY at reasonable times</li>
      <li> Babies crying</li>
      <li> A one-off party if noise was the only issue and it is unlikely to be repeated</li>
      <li> Children playing (including ball games)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Police responsibility</h3>
    <p>South Yorkshire Police are responsible for dealing with any behaviour or activity which results in a criminal offence being committed.</p>
    <p>Where the perpetrator is an SCC tenant the Tenancy Enforcement and Sustainment Team (TEST) will work closely with SYP to ensure that any appropriate enforcement action is taken by the council.</p>
    <p>We feel, it is not appropriate to list specific incidents that Police deal with as this may result in the issue just being reported to police and not being routed to appropriate SCC teams who may also need to look at enforcement action.</p>
    <h3>Council Responsibility</h3>
    <p>We are responsible for incidents involving:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> abandoned vehicles</li>
      <li> dead animals</li>
      <li> dog fouling</li>
      <li> fly posting</li>
      <li> dumped, fly-tipped waste</li>
      <li> inoffensive graffiti</li>
      <li> non-hate crime graffiti</li>
      <li> littering</li>
      <li> lost, stray or barking dogs</li>
      <li> noise nuisance or DIY related noise (We cannot log anonymous complaints about noise as we rely on evidence from the complainant, and observations at the complainant’s home, to evaluate whether the noise is a statutory nuisance).</li>
      <li> syringes or needles</li>
      <li> dumped, fly-tipped waste (nobody present)</li>

    It is the customer's responsibility to seek and get any planning or building regulation approvals. Every request for permission will be assessed

          You must not keep any animal which we consider to be dangerous or which may cause a nuisance. You must not keep a dog or a cat in a flat or maisonette which has shared parts or a shared entrance. If you live in a small block of flats or maisonettes, we will give you written permission to keep a dog or cat if all the tenants who use the same shared parts of the building have agreed to you keeping the dog or cat. 
          If we give our permission, we may withdraw it if your pet causes nuisance or upset to any of your neighbours. If we gave you written permission before 3rd April 1995 to keep a dog or cat in a block of flats containing more than 12 homes, you can continue to keep that dog or cat. 
          You must not keep any pigeons or doves in or on any part of the property unless before 3rd April 1995 we gave you written permission to do so. Parrots, budgies, etc., are allowed as long as they are not causing a nuisance.

        <h3>Reasons for us evicting you</h3>
        <div class="accordion-icon"></div>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The Council Housing Service can only evict you on behalf of the Council if the Council Housing Service gives you a “Notice Seeking Possession” and applies to the court to end your tenancy. The Council Housing Service can evict you from your home if the court thinks this is reasonable for any of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have not paid the rent or not kept to these conditions.</li>
            <li>You or anybody living with you or visiting you has caused a nuisance or annoyance to other people, has been convicted for using the premises for illegal or immoral purposes, or convicted of a serious offence in or near the premises.</li>
            <li>If you have been living with someone as their partner and your partner has left because of violence or threats of violence from you, either to them or a member of the family, and it is unlikely they will return.</li>
            <li>You have damaged the property or common parts.</li>
            <li>You or anybody living with you has damaged any furniture provided by the Council.</li>
            <li>You got the tenancy because you or somebody else on your behalf made false statements.</li>
            <li>You refuse to leave a property which we let to you temporarily while work was being carried out at your own property.</li>
            <li>You will usually have a chance to put things right before the Council Housing Service evicts you. The Council Housing Service will usually seek to evict you if you, your household or guests harass people (unless other legal action is more appropriate).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council Housing Service can evict you for the following reasons, if the court is satisfied that there is suitable alternative accommodation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If your home is overcrowded as defined in the Housing Act 1985.</li>
            <li>If your home is to be altered or demolished and this cannot be done while you’re still living there.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council Housing Service will consult you if the Council Housing Service wants to evict you because of these reasons. The Council Housing Service will also offer you alternative accommodation which meets your reasonable needs.</p>
        <p>The Council Housing Service can evict you for the following reasons if the court is satisfied that it is reasonable and you could get suitable alternative accommodation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The home was designed or adapted for a disabled person and there is no longer a disabled person living in the home but the home is required for a disabled person.</li>
            <li>The home is one to which special services are provided and there is no longer anyone living in the home who needs the special services and the home is required for someone who does.</li>
            <li>The home is much larger than you reasonably need and you have taken over the tenancy from another member of your family. (This reason is rarely used).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council Housing Service will consult you if the Council Housing Service wants to evict you because of these reasons. The Council Housing Service will also offer you alternative accommodation which meets your reasonable needs. If the Council Housing Service has to go to court you can challenge the reasons given by the Council Housing Service to evict you and/or the suitability of the alternative accommodation offered by the Council Housing Service. You should get legal advice before you do this. These reasons for ending tenancies are part of the Housing Act 1985.</p>

        <p>If you abandon your property, the Council Housing Service will treat it as a surrender of your tenancy, and the Council Housing Service may re-enter the property and relet it. You will be responsible for the rent until the Council Housing Service accepts the surrender. If you do not use the property as your only or principal home, the Council Housing Service may serve you with a Notice to Quit.</p>

    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>IMFIT (Rents) can provide a financial reference for you. Your Neighbourhood Support Team can provide a Tenancy Reference.</p>
        <p>Both of these may be subject to charges before the reference is returned.</p>
        <p>If this is for a mortgage company or a private landlord, the company needs to put this request in writing. There is a charge for this of £60, which must be paid to IMFIT before the reference is returned. The fee can be paid by debit/credit card or by BACS. If they want to pay this, transfer the call to IMFIT - this is NOT paid to the rent account.</p>

        <strong>Reference requests should be sent to:</strong><br>
        <address>
          Sheffield Council Housing Service<br>
          PO Box 5967<br>
          Sheffield<br>
          S2 9GH</p>
        </address>
        <p>For Social Landlords (Housing Associations), these also need to be put in writing, but there is no charge. Social Landlords can also email details of their request to <a href="mailto:customerservices@sheffield.gov.uk">customerservices@sheffield.gov.uk</a> if they prefer to send an email.</p>
