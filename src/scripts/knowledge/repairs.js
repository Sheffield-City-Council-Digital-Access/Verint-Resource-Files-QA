      <h3>Affordability</h3>
      <p>
        If you are in receipt of means tested benefits or your household income is
        below Â£21,000.00 you will not have to pay for the activity cost. Please
        complete the household income assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        If families receive other financial support, some of these might be able to be
        used to help with these costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your child attends a club that you find too expensive to pay on an ongoing
        basis you may be able to find a lower cost alternative.
      </p>
      <h3>If your child cannot attend a session</h3>
      <p>
        You will still need to pay because the staff are employed for each session to
        support your child, and so the club still has to pay these costs.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways of Paying</h3>
      <p>You will pay the club directly.</p>
