    <p>It is important that you only operate licensed vehicles that are driven by licensed drivers. The driver, vehicle, and operator must all be licensed by us.</p>

        Under the Equality Act 2010, the law says that you should carry passengers with assistance dogs and passengers in wheelchairs in your taxi.<br>
        You should provide these passengers with the help they need, and not charge them extra for doing so.<br>
        You might have a medical reason why you cannot do these things, and this is known as a medical exemption. There are two types of medical exemption:
        <ul>
            <li>Section 166 exemption certificate (passengers in wheelchairs)</li>

                <p>
                    The current Council Policy is to issue drivers with a licence for either 1, 2 or 3 years.<br>
                    You can make recommendations to the Council on the length of the Licence granted, up to the maximum of 3 years.<br>
                    You may see some underlying health issues that you believe require monitoring, and you may wish to inform the Council that, in your opinion, the applicant should be granted a shorter than normal term licence and that at the end of that licence they should be medically examined again.<br>
                    <br>
                    If a doctor makes a recommendation that a driver should be medically examined again within a period of time that is outside the current policies, the licence issued will reflect that, e.g. the doctor may state that the driver should be seen in 12 months, thus a licence would be issued only for a 12 month period.<br>
                    <br>
                    Doctors may also recommend that the applicant or driver be medically examined again outside of the normal referral policy, e.g., that a driver is seen prior to the birthday trigger points as set out by the policy or every three years rather than five years periods etc. This would be recorded by the Licensing Service and would not alter unless a doctor, after a full medical examination, determined that the driver could be placed back on the normal referrals’ procedure and timescales.

                <p>
                    As with all legislative matters, with any judgement made on an application to the Council there are some avenues for applicants to appeal the Decision of the Council.<br>
                    Your decision as a doctor becomes the Council decision as the reasons for refusal.<br>
                    <br>
                    The applicant may challenge your findings, and if they wish to do so they may firstly ask for their application to be referred to the Licensing Sub Committee for consideration.<br> 
                    If the Sub Committee decide to revoke or refuse to grant or renew their licence the applicant has a right of appeal to a Magistrates Court.
                    <br>
                    If an applicant asks for a Sub Committee Referral, or appeals a decision of the Council taken as recommended by you as the doctor, then you will be required to supply the Council with written statements explaining the decision.<br> 
                    This is at no extra cost to Sheffield City Council.<br>
                    <br>
                    Please be aware that on very rare occasions doctors have been summoned to Court or the Licensing Sub Committee to give evidence in person.<br> 
                    This is usually at the request of the appellant or their legal representatives.<br> 
                    In winning cases at the Magistrates Court, costs can be applied for. Invariably, full costs are never awarded to the Council and appellants usually only have to pay a contribution to the costs.<br>
                    Any attendance cost you incur for such instances will have to be recovered through the legal system and not from Sheffield City Council.

            Your private hire vehicle licence will be valid for a maximum of 12 months.
        /p>

        <h4>When to apply</h4>
        <p>We will usually contact you by email about 6 weeks before your vehicle licence is due to expire. This will tell you of your vehicle’s compliance test date and time.

        You should renew your licence in the month that it is due to end. If you miss this deadline, you will have up to one month to renew it. After that date, you will have to apply for a new private hire vehicle licence.
        If your licence does expire, you are not legally allowed to drive your vehicle for the purpose of hire and reward. You can only resume doing this when you receive confirmation that the licence has been renewed.</p>

        <h4>Cost</h4>

        We will then email you a PDF version of your licence and send you a paper version by post along with your licence plate.
        If your vehicle has been for a test within the last week of the month, we will give you the option to collect your licence so that you have it in time for the end of the month.
        If you are not available to collect your licence, you can send someone to collect it on your behalf.</p>

        <h3>Keeping your private hire or hackney carriage vehicle safe</h3>
    <p>
        Your vehicle needs to be checked regularly to make sure that it is safe to be used as a licensed private hire or hackney carriage vehicle. Because of high workloads and mileage, it will be tested according to it's age. If your vehicle is older, then it will need to be tested more regularly.<br>
        <br>
        Your vehicle must pass a compliance test at our testing station before we can issue a licence.
    </p>
    <h3>New vehicles</h3>
    <p>
        If your vehicle is new, then it needs to have passed a compliance test before we can issue a licence. This needs to happen even where it would not normally need an MOT test (if it is less than 3 years of age).<br>
        Before we can issue you with a test date you will need to make either a:
        <ul>
            <li>new private hire vehicle licence application</li>
            <li>new hackney carriage vehicle licence application</li>
        </ul>
        Once your vehicle has passed the test, you must licence the vehicle within either 10 days (for private hire vehicles) or 14 days (for hackney carriage vehicles) of the vehicle passing it's test.
    </p>
     <h3>Vehicles already licenced</h3>
    <p>
        Your vehicle needs to go through a compliance test no more than 4 weeks before it's licence is due to be renewed. <br>
        <br>
        When your vehicle is due to go for a test, we will usually email you about 6 weeks in advance with a date and time of the test.<br>
        <br>
        It is your responsibility to ensure you licence your vehicle on time and email <a href="mailto:taxilicensing@sheffield.gov.uk">taxilicensing@sheffield.gov.uk</a> or telephone <a href="#" class="telephoneNumber" onclick="copyToClipboard('0114 2734264')">0114 2734264</a> for a test date if you do not hear from us.   
</p>
    <h3>Changing your test date</h3>
    <p>
        If you need to change the test date, you should give us plenty of warning. We will accept nothing less than 24 hours' notice. If you do not give us enough notice to change the test, you will have to pay a missed test fee before you can rebook the test.<br>
        <br>
        You need to attend your vehicle's test. If you can't, then you may be asked to bring your plate back to us for safe keeping.
    </p>
    <h3>How often your vehicle needs to be testedV</h3>
    <p>
        The number of tests depends on how old your vehicle is.<br>
        <h4>Private hire vehicle testing</h4>
        You will need to test your private hire vehicle at the following intervals: <br>
        Under 5 years of age – every 12 months.<br>
        Over 6 years of age – every 6 months.<br>
        <h4>Hackney carriage vehicle testing</h4>
        You will need to test your hackney carriage vehicle at the following intervals:<br>
        under 9 years of age – every 12 months.<br>
        over 9 years of age – every 6 months.<br><br>
        The age of the vehicle and how often it will be tested is made clear by the V5C document that is presented when you apply for a vehicle licence.
    </p>
    <h3>Vehicles that fail</h3>
    <p>
       If your vehicle fails several tests in a row, you may be required to have your vehicle tested on a more regular basis.<br>
       If this is the case, we will tell you the reasons why we are doing this. You will have to pay for up to a maximum of 3 of these tests in any 12-month period.
    </p>
    <h3>Fees</h3>
    <h4>Compliance test</h4>

    <h3>How we test</h3>
    <p>
        Our vehicle inspection and testing go beyond that of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) test.<br>
        Because of the nature of taxi work done by hackney carriage vehicles, it is important that all areas of the vehicle are tested. <br>
        <br>
        We will check for:
        <ul>
            <li>how it works.</li>
            <li>how it looks.</li>
            <li>how safe it is.</li>
